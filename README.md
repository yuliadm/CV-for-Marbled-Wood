#### Description: 
Fungi, which normally decompose whole tree trunks, can conjure up works of art in wood. Empa researcher Hugh Morris has succeeded in creating dark lines in the wood with the help of a fire-crust fungus. The result is spalted wood that can be processed into unique furniture and musical instruments.
Empa researchers have now developed a technology, with which hardwoods such as beech, ash and maple can be specifically treated with fungal cultures so that the patterns in the wood can be controlled.
Certain types of fungi, when matched with each other, leave black lines caused by the pigment melanin and at the same time bleach the surrounding wood thanks to the fungal enzyme laccase. “This creates a pattern with a particularly strong contrast in the wood” explains Hugh Morris. Depending on the combination of fungal species, the lines are wild and impetuous or almost geometric. The researcher is convinced that the fungi can even, in time, be trained to write words in the wood. 
The fine black lines running through the wood are the traces of a battle. Sometimes they meander turbulently towards each other and separate small plots with lightened background. In other places, the dark drawings flow calmly as if they wanted to remind us of a boundary that none of the participants likes to cross: Fungi that have fought in a battle for territory and resources in the wood clearly separate themselves from each other with pigmented lines. With these demarcation lines, the fine threads of the fungal community not only protect their colony from other fungi – the black boundary also ensures that bacteria and insects stay away and the habitat retains an ideal amount of moisture.

#### Objective:
In this project, we want to learn to analyse the extent to which the pattern has developed in the marbled wood.
To that extent, we also want to be able to demarcate the battle fields of different fungial colonies.

#### Applications:

With spalted wood from local beech trees, however, it is possible to offer sought-after products on the Swiss timber market with an annual volume of around 3 billion Swiss francs.

In addition to furniture, parquet floors and kitchen fronts, spalted wood can also be used for decorative objects and musical instruments. Unique pieces have always been created from patterned wood. With the new technology, spalted wood can now be produced faster, more sustainably and with the desired marbling.
